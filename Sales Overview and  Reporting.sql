## The Sales Team requirement
/*
I hope all is okay with you. 
We wish to switch from static reports to visual dashboards and need to improve our internet sales reports.
In essence, we want to concentrate on the volume of sales we have made of specific products to specific clients over time.
Given that every salesperson deals with a different set of clients and items, the ability to filter them would be useful.

We evaluate our values to performance by comparing them to the budget, which I included in the spreadsheet. 
The budget is for 2021, but when we analyse sales, we often go back two years. */
