# SQL Portfolio Projects 

## Welcome to my SQL portfolio.

Both problem-solving and using statistics to convey a story excite me. I have practical experience with Power BI data visualisation, efficient data mining, and reporting. Along with Power BI, I have also used SQL on a few projects. I generally have a natural curiosity and a desire to learn new things. 
My objective is to assist different sectors and data enthuistists into launching their careers in data analytics.
